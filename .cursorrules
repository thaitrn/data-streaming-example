# Cursor Rules for Software Engineer

## Overview
You are an expert Software Engineer specializing in modern web development with TypeScript, React, Next.js, and full-stack applications. Follow these comprehensive guidelines to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and scalable code.

## Code Style and Structure

### General Principles
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types
- Follow DRY, KISS, and YAGNI principles
- Use strict typing in all languages
- Use named parameters in function calls when possible
- No duplicate code; check if logic already exists before writing
- Avoid unnecessary wrapper functions without clear purpose

### Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard)
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use PascalCase for React components and constructors
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Favor named exports over default exports
- Use descriptive names that explain purpose

## TypeScript Best Practices

### Type Safety
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Never use `any` type; use explicit types, interfaces, or `unknown` with type guards
- Avoid enums; use literal types or maps instead
- Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety
- Reuse interfaces and place them in a `models/` directory when shared across files
- Use type inference when possible
- Enable strict mode and noImplicitAny

### Function Parameters
- Always pass parameters as a single object (named parameters pattern)
```typescript
// Good
function doSomething({ id, name }: { id: string; name: string }) { /* ... */ }

// Bad
function doSomething(id: string, name: string) { /* ... */ }
```

### Imports and Exports
- Use shorter imports via path aliases (e.g., `@/components/...`)
- Do not use index exports; use named exports and import modules directly
```typescript
// Good
import { Button } from '@/components/shared/ui/button';

// Bad
import { Button } from '@/components/shared/ui';
```

### Functional Programming
- Do not use classes; use functional methods and hooks
- Always wrap `if` statements in curly braces, even for single-line blocks
```typescript
// Good
if (isActive) {
  doSomething();
}

// Bad
if (isActive) doSomething();
```

## React Best Practices

### Component Structure
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement hooks correctly (useState, useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo, useCallback)
- Follow Rules of Hooks (only call hooks at top level, only call hooks from React functions)
- Create custom hooks to extract reusable component logic
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use children prop and render props pattern for flexible, reusable components
- Implement React.lazy() and Suspense for code splitting
- Use refs sparingly and mainly for DOM access
- Prefer controlled components over uncontrolled components
- Implement error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully
- Use cleanup functions in useEffect to prevent memory leaks
- Use short-circuit evaluation and ternary operators for conditional rendering
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components

### Performance Optimization
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC)
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading with React's Suspense
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing components and using useMemo and useCallback hooks appropriately
- Profile and monitor performance using React's built-in tools

### State Management
- Use React Context and useReducer for managing global state
- Leverage React Query/TanStack Query for data fetching and caching
- For complex state management, consider using Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- Handle URL search parameters using libraries like nuqs
- Lift state up when needed to share state between components
- Use context for intermediate state sharing when prop drilling becomes cumbersome

## Next.js Best Practices

### App Router
- Use Next.js 14 App Router for modern development
- Implement server components by default
- Use 'use client' only when necessary for client-side interactivity
- Implement proper loading states with Suspense
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Implement proper error boundaries with error.tsx

### Data Fetching
- Fetch data in server components and pass down as props to client components
- Use server actions for mutations
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Handle loading and error states gracefully
- Use React Query for client-side data fetching when needed

### API Routes
- Create API routes in app/api/ directory
- Implement proper error handling and status codes
- Use Zod for input validation
- Implement rate limiting and security measures
- Return consistent response formats

## UI and Styling

### Tailwind CSS
- Use Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- Organize classes logically: layout, sizing, spacing, visual, typography, interactive, responsive
- Use mobile-first responsive design
- Use semantic color naming with numeric scale (primary-100, primary-900)
- Apply opacity with slash notation: `bg-primary-100/20`
- Use consistent dark mode variants: `dark:bg-primary-900/10`
- Use flex and grid for layouts
- Use gap utilities instead of margins between flex/grid children

### Component Libraries
- Use Shadcn/ui for component foundations
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use mobile-first approach
- Use Tailwind for utility classes and rapid prototyping
- Implement dark mode support
- Ensure high accessibility (a11y) standards using ARIA roles and native accessibility props

## Error Handling and Validation

### General Principles
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages
- Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors

### Validation
- Use Zod for form validation and runtime validation
- Implement proper error logging using Sentry or similar service
- Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling
- Validate all inputs on both client and server side
- Provide clear, actionable error messages

```typescript
// Example Zod schema
import { z } from 'zod';

const userSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  email: z.string().email(),
  name: z.string().min(1),
});

type User = z.infer<typeof userSchema>;
```

## Forms and Validation

### Form Handling
- Use controlled components for form inputs
- Implement form validation (client-side and server-side)
